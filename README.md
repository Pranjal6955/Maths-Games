   ```

5. **Run as a Sugar Activity:**
   - From Sugar, install the `.xo` bundle or run:
     ```bash
     python3 setup.py dev
     ```

6. **Run standalone (for development):**
   ```bash
   python3 MathsGamesActivity.py
   ```

## Troubleshooting Installation

- **Missing dependencies error**: Make sure you've installed all required packages:
